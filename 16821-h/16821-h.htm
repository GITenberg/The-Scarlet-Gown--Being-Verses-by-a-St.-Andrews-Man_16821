<h1>THE SCARLET GOWN:<br />
BEING VERSES BY A ST. ANDREWS MAN</h1>
<p>ST. ANDREWS, N.B.: A. M. HOLDEN<br />
LONDON: SIMPKIN, MARSHALL, HAMILTON &amp; CO.<br />
1891</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page i--><span class="pagenum">p. i</span>&lsquo;
. . . the little town,<br />
The drifting surf, the wintry year,<br />
The college of the scarlet gown,<br />
St. Andrews by the Northern Sea,<br />
That is a haunted town to me.&rsquo;</p>

<h2><!-- page ii--><span class="pagenum">p. ii</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>St. Andrews, but for its Town Council and its School Board, is a
quiet place; and the University, except during the progress of a Rectorial
Election, is peaceable and well-conducted.&nbsp; I hope these verses
may so far reflect St. Andrews life as to be found pleasant, if not
over exciting.</p>
<p>I am able to reprint the verses on &lsquo;The City of Golf&rsquo;
by the special courtesy of the Editor of the <i>Saturday Review</i>.</p>
<p>A few explanatory notes are given at the end of the book.</p>
<p>R. F. MURRAY.</p>
<h2><!-- page 1--><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>THE VOICE THAT SINGS</h2>
<p>The voice that sings across the night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of long forgotten days and things,<br />
Is there an ear to hear aright<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice that sings?</p>
<p>It is as when a curfew rings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Melodious in the dying light,<br />
A sound that flies on pulsing wings.</p>
<p>And faded eyes that once were bright<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brim over, as to life it brings<br />
The echo of a dead delight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice that sings.</p>
<h2><!-- page 2--><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>THE BEST PIPE</h2>
<p>In vain you fervently extol,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In vain you puff, your cutty clay.<br />
A twelvemonth smoked and black as coal,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis redolent of rank decay<br />
And bones of monks long passed away&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A fragrance I do not admire;<br />
And so I hold my nose and say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me a finely seasoned briar.</p>
<p>Macleod, whose judgment on the whole<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is faultless, has been led astray<br />
To nurse a high-born meerschaum bowl,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For which he sweetly had to pay.<br />
Ah, let him nurse it as he may,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the colour mounts much higher,<br />
The grate shall be its fate one day.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me a finely seasoned briar.</p>
<p><!-- page 3--><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>The heathen Turk of
Istamboul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In oriental turban gay,<br />
Delights his unbelieving soul<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With hookahs, bubbling in a way<br />
To fill a Christian with dismay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wake the old Crusading fire.<br />
May no such pipe be mine, I pray;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me a finely seasoned briar.</p>
<p>Clay, meerschaum, hookah, what are they<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I should view them with desire?<br />
Both now, and when my hair is grey,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me a finely seasoned briar.</p>
<h2><!-- page 4--><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>HYMN OF HIPPOLYTUS
TO ARTEMIS</h2>
<p>Artemis! thou fairest<br />
Of the maids that be<br />
In divine Olympus,<br />
Hail!&nbsp; Hail to thee!<br />
To thee I bring this woven weed<br />
Culled for thee from a virgin mead,<br />
Where neither shepherd claims his flocks to feed<br />
Nor ever yet the mower&rsquo;s scythe hath come.<br />
There in the Spring the wild bee hath his home,<br />
Lightly passing to and fro<br />
Where the virgin flowers grow;<br />
And there the watchful Purity doth go<br />
Moistening with dew-drops all the ground below,<br />
Drawn from a river untaintedly flowing,<br />
<!-- page 5--><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span> They who have gained
by a kind fate&rsquo;s bestowing<br />
Pure hearts, untaught by philosophy&rsquo;s care,<br />
May gather the flowers in the mead that are blowing,<br />
But the tainted in spirit may never be there.</p>
<p>Now, O Divinest, eternally fair,<br />
Take thou this garland to gather thy hair,<br />
Brought by a hand that is pure as the air.<br />
For I alone of all the sons of men<br />
Hear thy pure accents, answering thee again.<br />
And may I reach the goal of life as I began the race,<br />
Blest by the music of thy voice, though darkness ever veil thy face!</p>
<h2><!-- page 6--><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>ON A CRUSHED HAT</h2>
<p>Brown was my friend, and faithful&mdash;but so fat!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He came to see me in the twilight dim;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I rose politely and invited him<br />
To take a seat&mdash;how heavily he sat!</p>
<p>He sat upon the sofa, where my hat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My wanton Zephyr, rested on its rim;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its build, unlike my friend&rsquo;s, was rather slim,<br />
And when he rose, I saw it, crushed and flat.</p>
<p>O Hat, that wast the apple of my eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy brim is bent, six cracks are in thy crown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I shall never wear thee any more;<br />
Upon a shelf thy loved remains shall lie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with the years the dust will settle down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On thee, the neatest hat I ever wore!</p>
<h2><!-- page 7--><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE</h2>
<p>Short space shall be hereafter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere April brings the hour<br />
Of weeping and of laughter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of sunshine and of shower,<br />
Of groaning and of gladness,<br />
Of singing and of sadness,<br />
Of melody and madness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all sweet things and sour.</p>
<p>Sweet to the blithe bucolic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knows nor cribs nor crams,<br />
Who sees the frisky frolic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of lanky little lambs;<br />
<!-- page 8--><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span> But sour beyond expression<br />
To one in deep depression<br />
Who sees the closing session<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And imminent exams.</p>
<p>He cannot hear the singing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of birds upon the bents,<br />
Nor watch the wildflowers springing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor smell the April scents.<br />
He gathers grief with grinding,<br />
Foul food of sorrow finding<br />
In books of dreary binding<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And drearier contents.</p>
<p>One hope alone sustains him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And no more hopes beside,<br />
One trust alone restrains him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From shocking suicide;<br />
<!-- page 9--><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span> He will not play nor
palter<br />
With hemlock or with halter,<br />
He will not fear nor falter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever chance betide.</p>
<p>He knows examinations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like all things else have ends,<br />
And then come vast vacations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And visits to his friends,<br />
And youth with pleasure yoking,<br />
And joyfulness and joking,<br />
And smilingness and smoking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For grief to make amends.</p>
<h2><!-- page 10--><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>SWEETHEART</h2>
<p>Sweetheart, that thou art fair I know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More fair to me<br />
Than flowers that make the loveliest show<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To tempt the bee.</p>
<p>When other girls, whose faces are,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside thy face,<br />
As rushlights to the evening star,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deny thy grace,</p>
<p>I silent sit and let them speak,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As men of strength<br />
Allow the impotent and weak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To rail at length.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>If they should tell
me Love is blind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so doth miss<br />
The faults which they are quick to find,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d answer this:</p>
<p>Envy is blind; not Love, whose eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are purged and clear<br />
Through gazing on the perfect skies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of thine, my dear.</p>
<h2><!-- page 12--><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>MUSIC FOR THE DYING</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">from the french of sully prudhomme</span></p>
<p>Ye who will help me in my dying pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak not a word: let all your voices cease.<br />
Let me but hear some soft harmonious strain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I shall die at peace.</p>
<p>Music entrances, soothes, and grants relief<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From all below by which we are opprest;<br />
I pray you, speak no word unto my grief,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But lull it into rest.</p>
<p>Tired am I of all words, and tired of aught<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That may some falsehood from the ear conceal,<br />
Desiring rather sounds which ask no thought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which I need only feel:</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>A melody in whose
delicious streams<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The soul may sink, and pass without a breath<br />
From fevered fancies into quiet dreams,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From dreaming into death.</p>
<h2><!-- page 14--><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>FAREWELL TO A SINGER</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">on her marriage</span></p>
<p>As those who hear a sweet bird sing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And love each song it sings the best,<br />
Grieve when they see it taking wing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And flying to another nest:</p>
<p>We, who have heard your voice so oft,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And loved it more than we can tell,<br />
Our hearts grow sad, our voices soft,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our eyes grow dim, to say farewell.</p>
<p>It is not kind to leave us thus;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet we forgive you and combine,<br />
Although you now bring grief to us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To wish you joy, for auld lang syne.</p>
<h2><!-- page 15--><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>THE CITY OF GOLF</h2>
<p>Would you like to see a city given over,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Soul and body, to a tyrannising game?<br />
If you would, there&rsquo;s little need to be a rover,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For St. Andrews is the abject city&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>It is surely quite superfluous to mention,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To a person who has been here half an hour,<br />
That Golf is what engrosses the attention<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the people, with an all-absorbing power.</p>
<p>Rich and poor alike are smitten with the fever;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their business and religion is to play;<br />
And a man is scarcely deemed a true believer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless he goes at least a round a day.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>The city boasts
an old and learned college,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where you&rsquo;d think the leading industry was Greek;<br />
Even there the favoured instruments of knowledge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are a driver and a putter and a cleek.</p>
<p>All the natives and the residents are patrons<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of this royal, ancient, irritating sport;<br />
All the old men, all the young men, maids and matrons&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The universal populace, in short.</p>
<p>In the morning, when the feeble light grows stronger,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You may see the players going out in shoals;<br />
And when night forbids their playing any longer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They tell you how they did the different holes</p>
<p>Golf, golf, golf&mdash;is all the story!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In despair my overburdened spirit sinks,<br />
Till I wish that every golfer was in glory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I pray the sea may overflow the links.</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>One slender, struggling
ray of consolation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sustains me, very feeble though it be:<br />
There are two who still escape infatuation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend M&rsquo;Foozle&rsquo;s one, the other&rsquo;s
me.</p>
<p>As I write the words, M&rsquo;Foozle enters blushing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a brassy and an iron in his hand . . .<br />
This blow, so unexpected and so crushing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is more than I am able to withstand.</p>
<p>So now it but remains for me to die, sir.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stay!&nbsp; There <i>is</i> another course I may pursue&mdash;<br />
And perhaps upon the whole it would be wiser&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I will yield to fate and be a golfer too!</p>
<h2><!-- page 18--><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>THE SWALLOWS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">from jean pierre claris florian</span></p>
<p>I love to see the swallows come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At my window twittering,<br />
Bringing from their southern home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; News of the approaching spring.<br />
&lsquo;Last year&rsquo;s nest,&rsquo; they softly say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Last year&rsquo;s love again shall see;<br />
Only faithful lovers may<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell you of the coming glee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the first fell touch of frost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strips the wood of faded leaves,<br />
Calling all their wing&egrave;d host,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The swallows meet above the eaves<br />
<!-- page 19--><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span> &lsquo;Come away,
away,&rsquo; they cry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Winter&rsquo;s snow is hastening;<br />
True hearts winter comes not nigh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They are ever in the spring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If by some unhappy fate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Victim of a cruel mind,<br />
One is parted from her mate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And within a cage confined,<br />
Swiftly will the swallow die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pining for her lover&rsquo;s bower,<br />
And her lover watching nigh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dies beside her in an hour.</p>
<h2><!-- page 20--><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>AFTER MANY DAYS</h2>
<p>The mist hangs round the College tower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ghostly street<br />
Is silent at this midnight hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save for my feet.</p>
<p>With none to see, with none to hear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Downward I go<br />
To where, beside the rugged pier,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sea sings low.</p>
<p>It sings a tune well loved and known<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In days gone by,<br />
When often here, and not alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I watched the sky.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>That was a barren
time at best,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its fruits were few;<br />
But fruits and flowers had keener zest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fresher hue.</p>
<p>Life has not since been wholly vain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And now I bear<br />
Of wisdom plucked from joy and pain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some slender share.</p>
<p>But, howsoever rich the store,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d lay it down,<br />
To feel upon my back once more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The old red gown.</p>
<h2><!-- page 22--><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>HORACE&rsquo;S
PHILOSOPHY</h2>
<p>What the end the gods have destined unto thee and unto me,<br />
Ask not: &rsquo;tis forbidden knowledge.&nbsp; Be content, Leuconoe.<br />
Let alone the fortune-tellers.&nbsp; How much better to endure<br />
Whatsoever shall betide us&mdash;even though we be not sure<br />
Whether Jove grants other winters, whether this our last shall be<br />
That upon the rocks opposing dashes now the Tuscan sea.<br />
Be thou wise, and strain thy wines, and mindful of life&rsquo;s brevity<br />
Stint thy hopes.&nbsp; The envious moments, even while we speak, have
flown;<br />
Trusting nothing to the future, seize the day that is our own.</p>
<h2><!-- page 23--><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>ADVENTURE OF A
POET</h2>
<p>As I was walking down the street<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A week ago,<br />
Near Henderson&rsquo;s I chanced to meet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A man I know.</p>
<p>His name is Alexander Bell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His home, Dundee;<br />
I do not know him quite so well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As he knows me.</p>
<p>He gave my hand a hearty shake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussed the weather,<br />
And then proposed that we should take<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A stroll together.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Down College Street
we took our way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And there we met<br />
The beautiful Miss Mary Gray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That arch coquette,<br />
Who stole last spring my heart away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And has it yet.</p>
<p>That smile with which my bow she greets,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would it were fonder!<br />
Or else less fond&mdash;since she its sweets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On all must squander.<br />
Thus, when I meet her in the streets,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I sadly ponder,<br />
And after her, as she retreats,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My thoughts will wander.</p>
<p>And so I listened with an air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of inattention,<br />
While Bell described a folding-chair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of his invention.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>And when we reached
the Swilcan Burn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;It looks like rain,&rsquo;<br />
Said I, &lsquo;and we had better turn.&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas all in vain,</p>
<p>For Bell was weather-wise, and knew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The signs aerial;<br />
He bade me note the strip of blue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the Imperial,</p>
<p>Also another patch of sky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; South-west by south,<br />
Which meant that we might journey dry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Eden&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>He was a man with information<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On many topics:<br />
He talked about the exploration<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Poles and Tropics,</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>The scene in Parliament
last night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir William&rsquo;s letter;<br />
&lsquo;And do you like the electric light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or gas-lamps better?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The strike among the dust-heap pickers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He said was over;<br />
And had I read about the liquors<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Just seized at Dover?</p>
<p>Or the unhappy printer lad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At Rothesay drowned?<br />
Or the Italian ironclad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That ran aground?</p>
<p>He told me stories (lately come)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of good society,<br />
Some slightly tinged with truth, and some<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With impropriety.</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>He spoke of duelling
in France,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then lightly glanced at<br />
Mrs. Mackenzie&rsquo;s monster dance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which he had danced at.</p>
<p>So he ran on, till by-and-by<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A silence came,<br />
For which I greatly fear that I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was most to blame.</p>
<p>Then neither of us spoke a word<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For quite a minute,<br />
When presently a thought occurred<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With promise in it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did you like the Shakespeare play<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The students read?&rsquo;<br />
By this, the Eden like a bay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before us spread.</p>
<p><!-- page 28--><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Near Eden many softer
plots<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of sand there be;<br />
Our feet, like Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariots,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drave heavily.</p>
<p>And ere an answer I could frame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that Irving<br />
Of his extraordinary fame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was undeserving,</p>
<p>And for his part he thought more highly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Ellen Terry;<br />
Although he knew a girl named Riley<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At Broughty Ferry,</p>
<p>Who might be, if she only chose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As great a star.<br />
She had a part in the tableaux<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At the bazaar.</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>If I had said but
little yet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I now said less,<br />
And smoked a home-made cigarette<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In mute distress.</p>
<p>The smoke into his face was blown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the wind&rsquo;s action,<br />
And this afforded me, I own,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some satisfaction;</p>
<p>But still his tongue received no check<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till, coming home,<br />
We stood beside the ancient wreck<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And watched the foam</p>
<p>Wash in among the timbers, now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunk deep in sand,<br />
Though I can well remember how<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to stand</p>
<p><!-- page 30--><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>On windy days and
hold my hat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And idly turn<br />
To read &lsquo;Lovise, Frederikstad&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon her stern.</p>
<p>Her stern long since was buried quite,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And soon no trace<br />
The absorbing sand will leave in sight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To mark her place.</p>
<p>This reverie was not permitted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To last too long.<br />
Bell&rsquo;s mind had left the stage, and flitted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To fields of song.</p>
<p>And now he spoke of <i>Marmion</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Lewis Morris;<br />
The former he at school had done,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Along with Horace.</p>
<p><!-- page 31--><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>His maiden aunts,
no longer young,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But learned ladies,<br />
Had lately sent him <i>Songs Unsung</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Epic of Hades</i>,</p>
<p><i>Gycia</i>, and <i>Gwen</i>.&nbsp; He thought them fine;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not like that Browning,<br />
Of whom he would not read a line,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He told me, frowning.</p>
<p>Talking of Horace&mdash;very clever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond a doubt,<br />
But what the Satires meant, he never<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet could make out.</p>
<p>I said I relished Satire Nine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the First Book;<br />
But he had skipped to the divine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliza Cook.</p>
<p><!-- page 32--><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>He took occasion

<h2><!-- page 67--><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>ANDREW M&rsquo;CRIE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">from the unpublished remains of edgar allan poe</span></p>
<p>It was many and many a year ago,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a city by the sea,<br />
That a man there lived whom I happened to know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the name of Andrew M&rsquo;Crie;<br />
And this man he slept in another room,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But ground and had meals with me.</p>
<p>I was an ass and he was an ass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In this city by the sea;<br />
But we ground in a way which was more than a grind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I and Andrew M&rsquo;Crie;<br />
In a way that the idle semis next door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Declared was shameful to see.</p>
<p><!-- page 68--><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>And this was the
reason that, one dark night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In this city by the sea,<br />
A stone flew in at the window, hitting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The milk-jug and Andrew M&rsquo;Crie.<br />
And once some low-bred tertians came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bore him away from me,<br />
And shoved him into a private house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the people were having tea.</p>
<p>Professors, not half so well up in their work,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Went envying him and me&mdash;<br />
Yes!&mdash;that was the reason, I always thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (And Andrew agreed with me),<br />
Why they ploughed us both at the end of the year,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Chilling and killing poor Andrew M&rsquo;Crie.</p>
<p>But his ghost is more terrible far than the ghosts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of many more famous than he&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of many more gory than he&mdash;<br />
And neither visits to foreign coasts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 69--><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>Nor tonics,
can ever set free<br />
Two well-known Profs from the haunting wraith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the injured Andrew M&rsquo;Crie.</p>
<p>For at night, as they dream, they frequently scream,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Have mercy, Mr. M&rsquo;Crie!&rsquo;<br />
And at morn they will rise with bloodshot eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the very first thing they will see,<br />
When they dare to descend to their coffee and rolls,<br />
Sitting down by the scuttle, the scuttle of coals,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a volume of notes on its knee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the spectre of Andrew M&rsquo;Crie.</p>
<h2><!-- page 70--><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>AN INTERVIEW</h2>
<p>I met him down upon the pier;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His eyes were wild and sad,<br />
And something in them made me fear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he was going mad.</p>
<p>So, being of a prudent sort,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood some distance off,<br />
And before speaking gave a short<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Conciliatory cough.</p>
<p>I then observed, &lsquo;What makes you look<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So singularly glum?&rsquo;<br />
No notice of my words he took.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I said, &lsquo;Pray, are you dumb?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 71--><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>&lsquo;Oh no!&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;I do not think<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My power of speech is lost,<br />
But when one&rsquo;s hopes are black as ink,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, talking is a frost.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see, I&rsquo;m in for Math. again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And certain to be ploughed.<br />
Please tell me where I could obtain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An inexpensive shroud.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I told him where such things are had,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Well made, and not too dear;<br />
And, feeling really very sad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I left him on the pier.</p>
<h2><!-- page 72--><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>THE M.A. DEGREE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">after wordsworth</span></p>
<p>It was a phantom of delight<br />
When first it gleamed upon my sight,<br />
A scholarly distinction, sent<br />
To be a student&rsquo;s ornament.<br />
The hood was rich beyond compare,<br />
The gown was a unique affair.<br />
By this, by that my mind was drawn<br />
Then, in my academic dawn;<br />
A dancing shape, an image gay<br />
Before me then was my M.A.</p>
<p>I saw it upon nearer view,<br />
A glory, yet a bother too!<br />
<!-- page 73--><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span> For I perceived that
I should be<br />
Involved in much Philosophy<br />
(A branch in which I could but meet<br />
Works that were neither light nor sweet);<br />
In Mathematics, not too good<br />
For human nature&rsquo;s daily food;<br />
And Classics, rendered in the styles<br />
Of Kelly, Bohn, and Dr. Giles.</p>
<p>And now I own, with some small spleen,<br />
A most confounded ass I&rsquo;ve been;<br />
The glory seems an empty breath,<br />
And I am nearly bored to death<br />
With Reason, Consciousness, and Will,<br />
And other things beyond my skill,<br />
Discussed in books all darkly planned<br />
And more in number than the sand.<br />
Yet that M.A. still haunts my sight,<br />
With something of its former light.</p>

<p>Two old St. Andrews men, after a separation of nearly thirty years,
meet by chance at a wayside inn.&nbsp; They interchange experiences;
and at length one of them, who is an admirer of Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s

<p>I drove a golf-ball into the air,<br />
It fell to earth, I knew not where;<br />
For, so swiftly it flew, the sight<br />
Could not follow it in its flight.</p>
<p>I lent five shillings to some men,<br />
They spent it all, I know not when,<br />
For who is quick enough to know<br />
The time in which a crown may go?</p>
<p>Long, long afterward, in a whin<br />

But the five shillings are missing still!<br />
They haven&rsquo;t turned up, and I doubt if they will.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we think so too.</p>

<p>Once we shared the delightful delusion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That to edit was racy and rare,<br />
But we suffered a sad disillusion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we found that our castles were air;<br />
We had decked them with carvings and gildings,<br />

But all of a sudden the buildings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Came down with a run.</p>
<p>Not a trace was there left of the carving,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the gilding had vanished from sight;<br />
But the &lsquo;column&rsquo; for matter was starving,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we had not to edit&mdash;but write.<br />
So we set to and wrote.&nbsp; Can you wonder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If the writing was feeble or dead?<br />
We had started as editors&mdash;Thunder!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We were authors instead.</p>

I sought delights beyond my ken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The deep delights of Mathematics.</p>

She lived in a mill, as they all do<br />

But she faded in the autumn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the leaves began to fade,<br />
And the night before she faded,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These words to me she said:<br />
&lsquo;Do not forget me, Henry,<br />

But I must not bide, for the world is wide,<br />

With my elbow on one of their tombstones,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, why did they all of them fade?&rsquo;<br />

<p>He brought a team from Inversnaid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To play our Third Fifteen,<br />
A man whom none of us had played<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And very few had seen.</p>
<p>He weighed not less than eighteen stone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to a practised eye<br />
He seemed as little fit to run<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As he was fit to fly.</p>
<p>He looked so clumsy and so slow,<br />

But he got in behind&mdash;and oh,<br />

Eager-hearted as a boy when first he leaves his father&rsquo;s manse</p>
<p>With some money in his pocket, with some down upon his cheek,<br />
With the elements of Latin, with the rudiments of Greek.</p>

When I saw my name omitted from the schedule in the cage!</p>
<p>Grief is strong but youth elastic, and I rallied from the blow,<br />
For I felt that there were few things in the world I did not know.</p>
<p>Then my ready-made opinions upon all things under heaven<br />
I declaimed with sound and fury, to an audience of eleven</p>

<p>For the information of those who have not the happiness to be members
of the University of St. Andrews, it may be well to explain a few terms.&nbsp;
A <i>bejant</i> is an undergraduate student of the first year.&nbsp;
In his second year he becomes a <i>semi</i>, in his third a <i>tertian</i>,
and in his fourth a <i>magistrand</i>.&nbsp; The last would seem to
be a gerundive form, implying that a man at the end of his fourth year
ought to be made a Master of Arts; but unfortunately this does not always
happen.&nbsp; A <i>divine</i> is a student in Divinity.&nbsp; A <i>waster</i>
is a man of idle and (it may be) profligate habits.&nbsp; A <i>grinder</i>,
on the contrary, is one who &lsquo;grinds&rsquo; or reads with an unusual
degree of application.&nbsp; A <i>bunk</i> is the lodging or abode in
St. Andrews of any student.&nbsp; A <i>spree</i> is not necessarily
an entertainment of rowdy character; the most decorous Professorial
dinner-party would be called a spree.&nbsp; A <i>solatium</i> is a Debating
Society spree, held in December or January; a <i>gaudeamus</i> is a
festival of the same kind, only rather more ambitious, celebrated towards
the close of the session.&nbsp; <i>Session</i> would be rendered in
England by <!-- page 122--><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>&lsquo;term.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The <i>Competition</i> (for <i>Bursaries</i>), or the &lsquo;Comp.,&rsquo;
is the examination for entrance scholarships.&nbsp; The <i>cage</i>
is a curious structure of glass, iron, and wood, in which notices and
examination lists are posted.&nbsp; The letters <i>S. R. C</i>. denote
the Students&rsquo; Representative Council.&nbsp; An <i>L.L.A</i>. is
a Lady Literate in Arts.&nbsp; <i>Math</i>. (as the discerning reader
will not be slow to perceive) is an abbreviation, endearing or otherwise,
of the word Mathematics.&nbsp; <i>Moral</i> stands for Moral Philosophy.&nbsp;
<i>Prof</i>. is a shortened form of Professor, and <i>certif</i>. of
certificate.&nbsp; <i>Plough, pluck</i>, and <i>spin</i> are used indifferently,
to signify the action of an examiner in rejecting a candidate for the
M.A. or any other degree.&nbsp; It should be mentioned that the degree
of B.A. is not now conferred by the Universities of Scotland.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
